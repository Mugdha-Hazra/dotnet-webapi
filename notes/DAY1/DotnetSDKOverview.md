## 1️⃣ .NET SDK (Software Development Kit) — The Main Toolset

The most important concept here is the **.NET SDK**.

When you install the SDK, you are getting **everything needed to develop and run apps**.

It includes:

### ✅ What the SDK Contains

| Component                    | Purpose                                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI (Command Line Interface) | Run commands like `dotnet new`, `dotnet run`        |
| Runtime                      | Executes your programs                              |
| Libraries                    | Common functions (strings, files, networking, etc.) |
| Driver                       | Launches .NET apps                                  |

So:

> **SDK = Build + Run + Manage .NET Apps**

Without SDK, you **cannot develop** properly.

---

## 2️⃣ .NET CLI (Command Line Interface)

The lecture emphasizes this tool:

```
dotnet
```

This is called the **.NET CLI**.

It is how you control .NET from the terminal.

### 🔹 Examples

| Command          | Meaning                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `dotnet new`     | Create project         |
| `dotnet build`   | Compile                |
| `dotnet run`     | Run app                |
| `dotnet publish` | Prepare for deployment |
| `dotnet --info`  | System info            |

This is important because:

> APIs are usually built, tested, and deployed using CLI.

Not only through Visual Studio.

---

## 3️⃣ .NET Runtime — How Programs Actually Run

Another major concept is **Runtime**.

When you run a .NET app:

```
dotnet run
```

It doesn’t run directly on Windows/Linux.

It runs on the **.NET Runtime**.

### Runtime Provides:

* Garbage Collector (memory cleanup)
* Type system
* Assembly loading
* Thread management
* Security

Think of it as:

> Runtime = Engine that executes your code

Without runtime → App won’t run.

---

## 4️⃣ Runtime Libraries — Basic Building Blocks

Along with runtime, you get **libraries**.

These give you:

* `string`
* `List`
* `File`
* `HttpClient`
* `DateTime`
* JSON tools

Example:

```csharp
string name = "API";
File.ReadAllText("data.txt");
```

These come from runtime libraries.

So:

> Libraries = Ready-made tools for coding

You don’t need to reinvent basic things.

---

## 5️⃣ ASP.NET Core Runtime — For Web & APIs

Since you’re learning Web API, this is very important.

The installer also installs:

> **ASP.NET Core Runtime**

This is what runs:

* Web APIs
* Web apps
* Microservices

Without this, your API cannot start.

So:

| Component       | Used For        |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| .NET Runtime    | Console/Desktop |
| ASP.NET Runtime | Web APIs        |

---

## 6️⃣ .NET Driver — App Launcher

The lecture mentions:

> “Dotnet driver”

This is simply the command:

```
dotnet
```

It is responsible for:

* Finding your app
* Loading runtime
* Starting execution

You don’t see it separately. It’s built into CLI.

---

## 7️⃣ Checking Installation (Verification Step)

The teacher makes you run:

### ✔️ Check SDK

```
dotnet --list-sdks
```

Shows:

> Which development kits are installed

### ✔️ Check Runtimes

```
dotnet --list-runtimes
```

Shows:

> Which engines are available

This ensures:

✅ Your system is correctly configured
✅ No missing components

Very important in real projects.

---

## 8️⃣ Version Awareness (Why Reviews Say “Outdated”)

The course uses:

> .NET 5

But today we use:

* .NET 6 (LTS)
* .NET 8 (LTS – current standard)

Concepts are same, but commands/features changed slightly.

That’s why some students say “outdated”.

But fundamentals are still valid.

---

## 9️⃣ Main Goal of This Lecture

This lecture is NOT about coding yet.

It is about:

> Preparing your development environment

Specifically:

✅ Install SDK
✅ Understand components
✅ Verify setup
✅ Prepare for API creation

Only after this, you can write APIs.

---

## 10️⃣ Summary: What You Learned (Apart from Downloading)

So apart from download, this lecture teaches:

### 📌 Core Concepts

1️⃣ What is SDK
2️⃣ What is Runtime
3️⃣ What is CLI
4️⃣ Difference between SDK & Runtime
5️⃣ How to verify installation
6️⃣ Why ASP.NET runtime matters
7️⃣ How .NET apps are executed

### 📌 In One Line

> “Before building APIs, you must understand the tools that run and manage them.”

---

## 11️⃣ What Comes Next (For You)

After this lecture, usually next step is:

```
dotnet new webapi
```
